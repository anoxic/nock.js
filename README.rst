=====
Nock, yo
=====

This is an implementation of Nock in JavaScript.  It borrows very heavily from `this python implementation`_, which you really ought to check out.  This implementation is for pedagogic purposes, i.e. to let people play around with nock in a web browser.  It's not intended to power a browser-based Arvo implementation, although if someone wants to take this and make that happen, that would be pretty awesome.

reason we're all here talking about this stuff..
